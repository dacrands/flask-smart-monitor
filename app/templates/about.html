    <h1>What is a SmartFrame?</h1>

    <p>You can think of the <strong>SmartFrame</strong> as a piece of functional art.</p>
    <p>The functionality comes from being able to view real-time weather information and the
      scrolling stock-ticker. The art comes from the configurable backrgound video.</p>
